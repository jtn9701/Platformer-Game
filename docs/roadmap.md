# Roadmap
## MVP
### Gameplay
- The game will initially consist of a endless gamemode where the player must survive for as long as possible.
- Enemies will spawn and try to kill the player, and the player should kill enemies.
- With each run in endless mode, a score will be calculated based on survival time and the number of enemies killed.

### Persistent State Management
- A JSON bin will be used to store the top 10 scores, similar to how it was done in LAB 6

## Final Product (Ideally)
### Gameplay
- Side scrolling-platformer where the player must reach the end after killing enemies to go the the next stage
- After X number of stages, the player will get to fight a boss

### Persistent State Management
- A JSON bin saving save data, so the user can exit the game, come back, and resume progress
